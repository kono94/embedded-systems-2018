 * File dcftype.h
 *
 * Defines a type that represents the raw message of
 * a DCF-77 signal.
 * The signal consists of 59 bits, therefore a bool array of size
 * 59 is declared as main data structure to save those bits.
 * To get the e.q. bitX of the signal, simply access the
 * array with index x;
 *
 * DCF bit 0 => DCF[0]
 * DCF bit 21 => DCF[21]
